<!-- start of lyrics -->
People like you always want back the love they gave away<br />
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed<br />
The more I think about it now the less I know<br />
All I know is that you drove us off the road<br />
<br />
Stay<br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br />
Had me in the palm of your hand<br />
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in<br />
Stay, hey, now you say you want it<br />
Back now that it's just too late<br />
Well could've been easy<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say<br />
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made<br />
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside<br />
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye<br />
<br />
Stay<br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br />
Had me in the palm of your hand<br />
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in<br />
Stay, hey, now you say you want it<br />
Back now that it's just too late<br />
Well could've been easy<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
Let me remind you this was what you wanted<br />
You ended it<br />
You were all I wanted<br />
But not like this<br />
Not like this<br />
Not like this<br />
Oh, all you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br />
Had me in the palm of your hand<br />
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in<br />
Stay, hey, now you say you want it<br />
Back now that it's just too late<br />
Well could've been easy<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
Hey, all you had to do was stay<br />
Had me in the palm of your hand<br />
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in<br />
Stay, hey, now you say you want it<br />
Back now that it's just too late<br />
Well could've been easy<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay<br />
All you had to do was stay
